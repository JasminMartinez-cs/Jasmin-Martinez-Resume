        <p class="lead mb-4">I come from a family of immigrant parents and a first generation student to attend a higher education institution. Currently a second year (third year academically) undergraduate university student that is hoping to major in Sociology with a minor in Education for my bachelorâ€™s degree.<br><br>

       Working to get my bachelor's degree in Sociology with an Education minor so I can focus on working and helping children of any age. Wish to be employed as either high school counselor helping students, especially seniors in their process of transitioning from high school to their proper colleges. Another choice of employment I would want to achieve is social work, helping children who have been placed in rough circumstances and helping them find proper help and resources.Before graduating from university I hope to get an internship within the area of work that I hope to be employed in. An internship will allow me to get first hand experience prior to finding the appropriate employment for me as this specific field of employment will require various expectations and hours to ensure I understand the seriousness that comes within this field of employment because it is specifically dealing with children.   
Before graduating from university I hope to get an internship within the area of work that I hope to be employed in. An internship will allow me to get first hand experience prior to finding the appropriate employment for me as this specific field of employment will require various expectations and hours to ensure I understand the seriousness that comes within this field of employment because it is specifically dealing with children.  <br><br>

        I have some experience working with children as I have volunteered at my local elementary school assisting the teachers from grades kindergarten to 2nd grade students, therefore I have had first hand experience with interaction between students, and peers while learning new skills such as communication, teamwork, tips and tricks to make a connection with students who have different personalities and forms of interaction with adults and teachers. 
        Volunteering at an elementary school has definitely been one of the best decisions I have made since it allowed me to develop important skills that will be constantly needed within the field of employment I want to be part of and it made me feel a deeper connection and longing to work with children and help them achieve goals. Seeing children flourishing and growing great impacts not just on the children but their parents, teachers, and myself because I know I helped the children grow meaning I played an important role for them.  
        I hope to be working in the field of helping children whether it means helping them academically grow and achieve goals, or helping them have the proper resources and the correct environmental setting to have a happy and proper childhood, I believe helping children is one the most important tasks any person can achieve for the future of the next generations. 
I hope graduating from a university will inspire other students to follow a similar path to strive and achieve whatever goals they have in life.
